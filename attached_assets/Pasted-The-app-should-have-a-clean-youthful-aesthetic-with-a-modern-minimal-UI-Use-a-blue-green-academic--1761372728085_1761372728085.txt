The app should have a clean, youthful aesthetic with a modern minimal UI. Use a blue-green academic color palette with soft gradients, rounded cards, and subtle shadows. The feel should be professional yet social, like a mix of Twitter, Google Classroom, and Discord.

Overall Concept

A student ecosystem where users can either join as a Student or register as a School Admin.
Students can view notes, announcements, and social feeds.
School admins can manage classes, timetables, and official announcements.
